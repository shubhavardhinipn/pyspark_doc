* Big data - huge amount of data in structured, unstructured or semi-structured data.
* 5 v's 
  -volume = the size of the data.
  -velocity = the speed of the data.
  -variety = represents different formats of data like structured,
  unstructured and semi-structured data.
  -value = extract useful data.
  -veracity = Quality of data is analysed.
  
  Hadoop Architecture.
  
* HDFS(Hadoop distributed file system), YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) and Map Reduce are the components in Hadoop Architecture.
* HDFS is the storage layer,
  YARN is the resource Management Layer,
  Map Reduce is the Application Layer.
  
* HDFS is the storage layer for Hadoop.
  Files in HDFS are broken into block-size chunks called data blocks.
  these blocks are then stored in slave nodes in cluster.
  HDFS follows Master-slave architecture.
  it have 2 daemons NameNode and dataNode.
  
*The NameNode is the master daemon that runs on Master node.
  NameNode stores in metadata system.
*The dataNode is the slave node that runs on slave nodes.
  DataNode stores in actual business data or unknown data.
  
*MapReduce works on key,value pairs.
 The input to the map function and output from the reduce function is the key, value pair.
 The function of the map tasks is to load, parse, filter, and transform the data.
 The output of the map task is the input to the reduce task.
 Reduce task then performs grouping and aggregation on the output of the map task.

*HDFS is the distributed file system in Hadoop for storing big data. 
MapReduce is the processing framework for processing vast data in the Hadoop cluster in a distributed manner. 
YARN is responsible for managing the resources amongst applications in the cluster.

*Hadoop Fault Tolerance- Each block of data is divided into multiple slaves which have a replica of each data chunk. 
In this way, a file will be restored easily if it fails from one node.


*A single node cluster means only one DataNode running and setting up
 all the NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, and NodeManager on a single machine.
